# Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms Laboratory

### Programs done in college are put up here.

Currently, there is/are :-
- dictionary.cpp : Studying and implementing a dictionary data structure with the help of C++.

- binary-tree.cpp : Implementing a binary tree and displaying with inorder traversal method using C++.

- binary-search-tree.cpp :- Creating a binary search tree.

- assignment-3 :- Creating a BST and finding its height, levels, leaf nodes and its mirror.

- dictionary-2.cpp :- A dictionary stores keywords and meanings. Provide facility for adding new keywords, deleting keywords, updating values of an entry and display the whole data sorted in ascending / descending order. Also, find out how many maximum comparisons may be required for finding any keyword. Use BST for implementation.
